Lab 3 is too heavy according to some students - simplify and possibly move stuff to other labs?

We should agree on how students are supposed to carry out each lab task, not only prep task. Criticism 2015 that we say different things. Example: lab 2 last task (max clock frequency)

Can we find another topic for handin 2 - still state machines, but not sequence estimation?

Post no datasheets on the course website (not needed since students find them easily on the web)
